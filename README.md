# JUCE_MultipleWavetables


Created using the JUCE framework!

 This code was written to create a standalone app that generates wavetables
 for the four basic waveshapes (sine, saw, triangle and square). This program
 also generates some other strange wavetables with very interesting timbres
 that change significantly based on the frequency. A sine wave is used as the
 base waveform which is modified based on the wavetable sample index.
